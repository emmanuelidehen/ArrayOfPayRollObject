/*
 * Design a PayRoll class that has data members for an employee's hourly pay rate and
 * number of hours worked. Write a program with an array of seven PayRoll objects. The
 * program should read the number of hours each employee worked and their hourly pay
 * rate from a file and call class functions to store this information in the appropriate
 * objects. It should then call a class function, once for each object, to return the employee's
 * gross pay, so this information can be displayed. Sample data to test this program can be
 * found in the payroll. dat file.
 *
 Psuedo code:
 
 create array of size 7
 open the file and check if the right file was opened!
 if file is not opened, wrong file
 else
 grab data from file into hour and rate
 pass pay rate and hours worked to each emplyee
 calciulate the gross pay and print each employee pay for a year!
